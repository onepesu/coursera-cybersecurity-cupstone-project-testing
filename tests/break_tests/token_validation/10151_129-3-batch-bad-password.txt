logappend -B batch will change the password during the batch execution
I believe the second entry should be invalid
the presence of 2 differents log names/password in the batch has been confirmed in the dicussion forum
here this is a crash

batch : 
-T 1 -K secret -G Bill -A log1
-T 2 -K secrete -G Bob -A log1
